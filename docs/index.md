## What is Codekub?

**Codekub** is a beginner-focused Linux setup script that installs and configures everything a **Computer Science / IT student** needs to start coding **from day one**.

Instead of spending weeks figuring out:

* which tools to install
* how to configure them
* why things break

Codekub gives you a **ready-to-learn development environment**, while also **teaching you what each tool does and why it exists**.

---

## How Codekub Works

Codekub is installed using a single command:

```bash
wget -qO- https://omakub.org/install | bash
```

> ⚠️ Note:
> The *idea* of using a single install script is inspired by **Omakub**, but **Codekub is a completely different project** with a different goal and audience.

## Codekub vs Omakub (Very Important Difference)

### Omakub

* Made for **experienced developers**
* Opinionated, fast, production-ready
* Assumes you already understand Linux, terminals, and tools
* Focuses on *getting work done quickly*

### Codekub

* Made for **beginners and students**
* Learning-first, explanation-driven setup
* Beginner-friendly defaults
* Focuses on *understanding tools*, not hiding them

👉 **Omakub installs tools.
👉 Codekub teaches tools.**

## Who Is Codekub For?

🎓 **CSE / IT students**
🧑‍💻 **Programming beginners**
🚀 **Anyone learning development tools from scratch**

If you are:

* new to Linux
* confused by terminals
* unsure why developers use tools like Git, Docker, or Neovim

**Codekub is for you.**

## What Codekub Installs

Codekub provides a **modern, real-world developer environment**, carefully chosen for learning.

### Programming Languages & Compilers

* C / C++
* Java
* Python
* Rust
* Node.js

### Developer Tools

* Git
* Docker
* VS Code
* Neovim
* Tmux
* Modern CLI utilities

### Environment Setup

* Preconfigured dotfiles
* Clean GNOME customizations
* Learning-friendly terminal setup
* Sensible defaults (no unnecessary complexity)

Everything works **out of the box**, but nothing is hidden.

## What Makes Codekub Different

Codekub emphasizes:

✅ Clear explanations of tools and configurations
✅ Beginner-oriented defaults
✅ Step-by-step guides
✅ Practical learning over “magic scripts”
✅ Modern development workflows
✅ A clean, beautiful Linux experience without overwhelm

Instead of *just installing tools*, **Codekub helps you understand them**.

---

## Learning-First Philosophy

Most setups assume:

> “You’ll figure it out later.”

Codekub assumes:

> “You are learning — let’s explain everything.”

You learn:

* what each tool does
* why developers use it
* how it fits into real projects

This makes Codekub ideal for:

* academic labs (personal learning)
* self-study
* first-time Linux users
* long-term skill building

---

## License & Usage Notice

✅ **Free for students and personal learning**
❌ **Not allowed for commercial use**
❌ **Not allowed for college labs or institutional deployment**

Codekub is built to help **individual learners**, not organizations.

---

## Project Background (Transparency Note)

This project started **before I knew about Omakub**.
Later, the **script-based installer idea** was inspired by Omakub.

However:

* Codekub has a **different mission**
* Codekub targets **beginners**
* Codekub focuses on **learning, not speed**
