## What is Codekub?

**Codekub** is a beginner-focused Linux setup script that installs and configures everything a **CSE/IT student** needs to start coding **from day one** — no guessing which tools to install or how to configure them.

It gives you a **ready-to-learn development environment** while also **explaining what each tool does**.

---

## How Codekub Works

Install with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeCompasss/codekub/main/boot.sh | bash
```

> ⚠️ Inspired by **Omakub**, but **Codekub is different** — it’s learning-first, not just installation.
