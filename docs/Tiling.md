Here’s a **beginner-friendly explanation** of **window tiling in GNOME and Tactile**, written in **Codekub style**, keeping it clear, concise, and actionable:

## Window Management & Tiling in GNOME

Managing multiple apps efficiently is **key for productivity**, especially when coding or working on projects.

---

### Basic Two-Way Tiling (For Small Screens)

GNOME comes with **built-in simple tiling**:

* **Super + Left Arrow** → Snap active window to the left half
* **Super + Right Arrow** → Snap active window to the right half
* **Super + Up Arrow** → Maximize the window (fills screen, top panel visible)

💡 Example: Place your **browser on the left** and **terminal on the right**.
This is ideal for **laptops with smaller screens**.

**Tip:** It’s a good alternative to one-app-per-workspace setups.

### Advanced Tiling with Tactile (For Big Screens)

If you have a larger monitor, you can use **Tactile**, which splits the screen into **6 regions by default**:

* **Center:** Two large slots
* **Wings:** Two slots on each side (smaller)

**Key commands:**

* **Super + T** → Activate Tactile grid
* **Super + T + [slot letters]** → Assign window to specific slots

💡 Examples:

1. Assign a **terminal to the E slot**: `Super + T E`
2. Expand it to fill both center slots: `Super + T W S`
3. Combine multiple apps: two terminals in wings, browser in center

Tactile lets you **fit multiple windows efficiently** without manually resizing each one.

### Moving Windows Manually

Sometimes manual adjustment is needed:

* **With title bar:** Click and drag the title bar
* **Without title bar (e.g., Alacritty terminal):** Hold **Super**, click anywhere inside the window, and drag

💡 Tip: This works even for windows with title bars, giving you **flexibility when needed**.

### Quick Summary

| Feature         | Shortcut / Action    | Use Case                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Snap left/right | Super + Left/Right   | Two-way tiling on small screens           |
| Maximize        | Super + Up           | Fill screen without hiding top panel      |
| Tactile grid    | Super + T            | Advanced multi-window tiling              |
| Move manually   | Super + click & drag | Adjust windows with or without title bars |

### Why This Matters for Developers

* Keep **terminal, IDE, browser, and documentation visible**
* Switch between **coding, testing, and debugging** quickly
* Reduces **time wasted resizing windows**
* Makes **multi-tasking natural**
