Clipboard #
Copy/paste is surprisingly complicated in Linux, if you're used to something like the Mac where everything uses the same clipboard and the same hotkeys everywhere. The complexity mainly comes from the fact that Ctrl + C/V does not work in the Linux terminal, since these keys are used for other purposes by various terminal applications. (And if you dive into Neovim, there's further complications!)

Anyway, for starters, know that in the terminal, you copy with Shift + Ctrl + C and paste with Shift + Ctrl + V. If you forget, you'll get a control character that you first have to delete before you can paste. It'll take a while to muscle memorize this change if you're not used to it!

To make matters worse, Zellij requires that you hold down Shift when you select a line in the terminal that you wish to copy to the system clipboard. And again, you have to press Shift + Ctrl + C to actually copy. And this mouse selection is even a bit finicky in terms of positioning. But you'll get the hang of it in no time. Don't wor 

there is also the clibpoard extentsion where you can see the cliboard in teh bottem bar whihc you can see the stuff you copied
