## Obsidian (How Software Engineers Think With Notes)

As a software engineer, learning is not just about writing code —
it’s about **thinking clearly**, **remembering concepts**, and **connecting ideas over time**.

That’s why many engineers use **Obsidian**.

## What Is Obsidian?

**Obsidian** is a **markdown-based note-taking app** designed for **thinking, learning, and knowledge building**.

Unlike normal note apps:

* Your notes are **plain text files**
* Stored **locally on your computer**
* Fully under **your control**

No cloud lock-in. No hidden formats.

## Why Software Engineers Use Obsidian

### 🧠 Engineers Think in Connections, Not Pages

Engineering knowledge is connected:

* Data Structures → Algorithms → Optimization
* Linux → Processes → Containers → Docker
* Git → Branching → CI/CD

Obsidian lets you **link notes together**, just like a graph of ideas.

This mirrors how engineers actually think.

### ✍️ Markdown Fits Engineers Perfectly

Obsidian uses **Markdown**, which engineers already use for:

* README files
* Documentation
* GitHub projects
* Technical writing

You write notes using simple text like:

```md
# Git Basics
- git init
- git commit
- git push
```

No formatting distractions.

### 🗂️ Your Knowledge Grows With You

Engineers don’t “finish learning” a topic.

With Obsidian:

* You start with simple notes
* Add details over time
* Link related concepts later
* Revisit and improve understanding

Your notes become a **personal knowledge base**.

---

### 🔒 Local-First & Offline

Engineers value **control and privacy**.

Obsidian:

* Stores notes locally
* Works fully offline
* Uses normal folders and files

You can back it up with Git, cloud sync, or USB — your choice.

### 📈 Used by Real Engineers (Not Just Students)

Obsidian is used by:

* Software engineers
* Security researchers
* System architects
* Researchers and writers

Many engineers treat Obsidian as their **second brain**.

---

## How Engineers Actually Use Obsidian

Typical real-world usage:

* Notes on programming languages
* Linux command explanations
* Debugging notes
* Project architecture ideas
* Interview preparation
* Personal learning journal

It’s not about pretty notes — it’s about **useful notes**.
