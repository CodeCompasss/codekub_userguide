## Git Alias (Shortcuts for Git Commands)

Git commands can feel **long and repetitive**, especially for beginners.

**Git aliases make Git easier and faster.**

---

## What Is a Git Alias?

A **Git alias** is a **short name** for a longer Git command.

It lets you type less and do more.

Example:

```bash
git st
```

instead of:

```bash
git status
```

Same result. Less typing.

## Why Engineers Use Git Aliases

### ⚡ Speed

Small shortcuts save time —
and Git is used many times a day.

---

### 🧠 Less Mental Load

Short commands are easier to remember.

This helps beginners focus on:

* understanding Git
* not memorizing long commands

---

### 🔁 Consistent Workflow

Aliases create **muscle memory**.

Over time, Git becomes natural instead of scary.

---

### 🏗️ Used by Professional Engineers

Almost every experienced engineer uses Git aliases.

They are a **normal part of real-world workflows**.

## Beginner Mental Model

Think of Git aliases as:

> “Nicknames for long Git commands.”

Nothing magical — just shortcuts.

---

## Common Beginner Git Aliases

```bash
git st    # status
git co    # checkout
git br    # branch
git cm    # commit
```

These are simple and safe.

---

## Where Git Aliases Live

Git aliases are stored in:

* your Git configuration
* not inside your project

So they work everywhere.
