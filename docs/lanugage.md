## Programming Languages (How We Talk to Computers)

Computers don’t understand human language.
They only understand **instructions**.

A **programming language** is a way for humans to **write instructions** that computers can understand and execute.

Think of a programming language as:

> A bridge between human thinking and machine execution.

## Why There Are Many Programming Languages

Different problems need different tools:

* Some languages are fast
* Some are easy to learn
* Some control hardware
* Some build websites
* Some power large systems

That’s why engineers learn **more than one language**.

## Common Programming Languages in Codekub

### Node.js (JavaScript on the Server)

**Node.js** lets you run **JavaScript outside the browser**.

Used for:

* backend servers
* APIs
* real-time apps
* tools and automation

Why engineers use it:

* same language for frontend and backend
* fast and event-driven
* huge ecosystem

Mental model:

> JavaScript for servers.

---

### Java (Write Once, Run Anywhere)

**Java** is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language.

Used for:

* enterprise software
* Android apps
* large backend systems

Why engineers use it:

* very stable
* huge industry usage
* excellent tooling

Mental model:

> Safe, structured language for big systems.

### PHP (Web-Focused Language)

**PHP** is a server-side language designed for the web.

Used for:

* websites
* content management systems
* backend logic

Why engineers use it:

* easy to start
* powers many websites
* great for web development

Mental model:

> Language made for websites.

---

### C (Close to the Machine)

**C** is a low-level programming language.

Used for:

* operating systems
* embedded systems
* compilers

Why engineers use it:

* very fast
* full control over memory
* teaches how computers really work

Mental model:

> Talk almost directly to hardware.

---

### C++ (C with Power and Abstractions)

**C++** builds on C with more features.

Used for:

* game engines
* system software
* high-performance applications

Why engineers use it:

* extremely powerful
* high performance
* used in complex systems

Mental model:

> C + advanced programming features.

---

### Python (Readable and Beginner-Friendly)

**Python** focuses on simplicity and readability.

Used for:

* scripting
* data science
* AI and machine learning
* automation
* web development

Why engineers use it:

* easy to learn
* very expressive
* huge library support

Mental model:

> Write less, do more.
