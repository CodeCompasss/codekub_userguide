## GitHub CLI (Work With GitHub Without Leaving the Terminal)

Good engineers don’t constantly switch between
**browser ↔ terminal ↔ browser**.

They use **GitHub CLI**.

---

## What Is GitHub CLI?

**GitHub CLI (`gh`)** lets you use **GitHub directly from the terminal**.

You can:

* create repositories
* manage pull requests
* review issues
* authenticate securely

All without opening a browser.

---

## Why Engineers Use GitHub CLI

### ⚡ Faster Workflow

No tab switching.

You stay in the terminal and:

* push code
* create PRs
* check CI status

Flow stays unbroken.

---

### 🧠 Less Cognitive Load

The terminal is where engineers already work.

GitHub CLI keeps:

* code
* version control
* collaboration

in one place.

---

### 🔐 Secure & Professional

* Uses official GitHub authentication
* No copying tokens manually
* Trusted by GitHub itself

---

### 🏗️ Used in Real Projects

GitHub CLI is common in:

* open-source contributions
* company workflows
* CI/CD automation

Learning it early builds **real-world habits**.

---

## Beginner Mental Model

Think of GitHub CLI as:

> “GitHub, but typed instead of clicked.”

Same actions — faster execution.

---

## One Simple Example

Create a repo and push code:

```bash
gh repo create
```

GitHub is ready in seconds.

---

## How Top Engineers Use It

* Create pull requests from terminal
* Review PRs without opening a browser

Same tool, more power.
