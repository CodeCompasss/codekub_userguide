## Postman (Talk to APIs and See What’s Really Happening)

When you build or use modern software, you often work with **APIs**.

But APIs are invisible — you can’t “see” them like a website.

**Postman lets you see and test APIs clearly.**

---

## What Is Postman?

**Postman** is a tool used to **send requests to APIs and view the responses**.

It helps you:

* test APIs
* understand how APIs work
* debug backend problems
* learn backend development

All without writing frontend code.

---

## Why Engineers Use Postman

### 🔍 See API Responses Clearly

Postman shows:

* returned data
* status codes
* errors
* response time

This makes debugging easy.

---

### 🧪 Test Without Writing Code

You can test an API by:

* entering a URL
* choosing GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
* clicking **Send**

Perfect for beginners.

---

### 🧠 Learn How APIs Work

Using Postman teaches:

* request methods
* headers
* JSON data
* authentication

These are core backend skills.

---

### 🤝 Used in Real Projects

Postman is used by:

* backend developers
* frontend developers
* QA engineers
* DevOps teams

It’s an industry-standard tool.

---

## Beginner Mental Model

Think of Postman as:

> “A remote control for APIs.”

You press buttons and see how the server responds.

---

## Simple Example

Send a request:

1. Open Postman
2. Enter an API URL
3. Select `GET`
4. Click **Send**

You instantly see the response.

---

## How Top Engineers Use Postman

* Debug backend issues
* Test authentication flows
* Share API collections with teams
* Verify APIs before deployment

Same tool — deeper usage.
