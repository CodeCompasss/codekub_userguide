## mise (One Tool to Manage All Tool Versions)

As you learn programming, you’ll notice a common problem:

> Different projects need different versions of the same tool.

For example:

* Project A needs **Node.js 18**
* Project B needs **Node.js 20**
* Another project needs a different Python version

**mise solves this problem.**

## What Is mise?

**`mise`** is a **tool version manager**.

It lets you:

* install different versions of tools
* switch versions per project
* avoid breaking your system setup

All from one place.

## Why Engineers Use mise

### 🔄 Manage Multiple Versions Easily

Instead of uninstalling and reinstalling tools, mise lets you:

* keep many versions
* switch automatically when you enter a project folder

No manual work.

---

### 🧠 One Manager for Many Tools

mise can manage:

* Node.js
* Python
* Java
* Ruby
* Go
* and many more

One tool instead of many separate managers.

---

### 📁 Project-Based Configuration

Each project can have a file that says:

> “Use this version of Node, Python, etc.”

mise reads it automatically.

This prevents:

* version conflicts
* broken builds
* confusion for beginners

---

### 🏗️ Used by Professional Engineers

mise is used in:

* real-world projects
* teams
* CI/CD pipelines

It replaces tools like `nvm`, `pyenv`, and others with one unified system.
